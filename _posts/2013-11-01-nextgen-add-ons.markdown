short-description: Re-styled interface for add-ons
---

Using the Styleguide that we created with our Nextgen app UI, I restyled and simplified the Engine Yard Add-ons Rails app.

The Add-ons UI is for adding third party services to your app on Engine Yard.

### UX for activating an Add-on

### Add-ons index page

I also did some styling to the admin interface that our partners use to manage their integration.
