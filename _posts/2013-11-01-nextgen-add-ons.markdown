I simplified the UI for activating third party services in Engine Yard's Add-ons Rails app.

Above is an example of how a customer would activate an Add-on on their
staging environment. It starts by selecting the Add-on from the listing, and ends with
activating it on a specific environment. (The steps that I didn't show
were the Add-on specific code changes that the customer has to make to their Rails app.)

For this project, I used the styleguide that we created alongside Engine Yard's Nextgen app ([ui.engineyard.com](https://ui.engineyard.com)) as a foundation.

I also did some styling to the admin interface that our partners use to manage their integration.
