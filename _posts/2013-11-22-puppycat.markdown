For Thanksgiving this year, I was Bee from Bee and PuppyCat.

I tried to convince my roommate's cat to dress up as PuppyCat, but she
proclaimed:

### "I don't like this costume!!"

Instead, I sewed my own PuppyCat plushie out of felt. Here are the steps.

First, cut out all the pieces.  

![Pieces]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/puppycat/puppycat-01-pieces.jpg)

Pin the two sides together, right side it. Stitch along the back.

Sew the four darts where the legs are. Clip the excess.

Pin the belly to the bottom of the sides, right side in. Sew it on, leaving the neck open.

Fill the body with stuffing.

On the face,sew the dart closed from the chin to the nose.

Sew the back of the neck together.
Pin the neck to the face, right side in, and sew all the way around.  Close the neck under the chin.

Sew the front of the ear to the back, good side in.

Sewing the pink collar pieces together, and fill with some stuffing.

Create the bell with four chevrons of yellow (I forgot the fourth in this
picture).

Attach the bell to the head by hand. I cut a U-shaped notch from the
body so the bell wouldn't stick out so far.

Attach the legs by hand.
