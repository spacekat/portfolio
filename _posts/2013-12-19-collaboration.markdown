I created this screen flow that allows organization administrators to add new users to their team and manage their access levels.

The individual user's gravatars would be in the circle, I just used the gravatar example dude to demonstrate how it could be laid out.

In this GIF, when a new member is being invited, the administrator can chose what projects they have access to.

When they invite the new member, an email is sent that could look like this.

### Here's a static shot of how team members could be organized.

They are grouped by access level, and the bottom colored bar on each
tile says what group they are in.

Here is some early planning on how the various access levels could be approached.
