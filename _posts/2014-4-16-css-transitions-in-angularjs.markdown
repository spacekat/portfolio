I gave this talk at a Sass meetup called The Mixin, in San Francisco, Thursday April 17th.

### An introduction to designing CSS transitions using AngularJS

I show examples of how a UI designer without much JS or AngularJS experience can use some of the features built in to AngularJS (with angular-animate) to help them design interactive components and add CSS transitions.
