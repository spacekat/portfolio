Along with a team of front end developers Gerlando Piro ([@gpxl](https://twitter.com/gpxl)), Brendan Hastings, and Ronan Flynn ([@flynnduism](http://twitter.com/flynnduism)), I helped to bring the rebranded website for Engine Yard to life.

### [www.engineyard.com](http://www.engineyard.com)

I focused on making the pages mobile and tablet friendly.

### desktop
<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/engineyarddotcom/website-desktop.png" alt="Desktop" style="width: 800px;"/>

### mobile
<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/engineyarddotcom/website-mobile-home.jpg" alt="Engine Yard website home" style="width: 320px;"/>

I made the header collapse in a way that shows the navigation links for as long as possible.

The navigaton finally collapses into a dropdown when they can no longer be displayed in line.

I updated our styleguide from Bootstrap 2 to use the [Bootstrap 3 grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) so that it would be easier to setup responsive breakpoints.
