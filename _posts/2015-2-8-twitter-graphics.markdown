short-description: Some graphics for hackweek and fun
---

For fun I made these graphics.

### Hackweek team logo

For Hackweek, the ngTwitter team asked me to make their team logo. It's a combination of the angularJS logo and the Twitter bird, using the Twitter color palette.

### The Left Bird

I made a left shark mashup with the Twitter logo for fun.

(This is as close as I got to watching the superbowl)
