In January 2014, Ines ([@randommood](@randommood)), Elaine ([@ejgreenberg](@ejgreenberg)), and I hosted another Rails Girls event at Engine Yard.

### [railsgirls.com/sanfrancisco](http://railsgirls.com/sanfrancisco)

I made images to promote the event with the SF skyline view from our office as the background.
